Most of these example scripts are written in Scala. Currently version 2.8 is used, but this might change.  To run them you need to ensure that all of the .jar's from the lib folder are specified on the JVM's classpath.  The best way is the make an enviroment variable, say RSIMLIB, linking to all the the .jar's. For example, in unix do

export RSIMLIB=$RSIMDIR/lib/RobbySim.jar:$RSIMDIR/lib/colt.jar:$RSIMDIR/lib/flanagan.jar:$RSIMDIR/lib/RngPack.jar:$RSIMDIR/lib/Jama-1.0.2.jar

where $RSIMDIR is the directory pointing to the robbysim files. Then the command

scala -classpath $RSIMLIB scriptname.scala

will run the script.
