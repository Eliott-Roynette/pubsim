Most of these example scripts are written in Scala. Currently version 2.8 is used, but this might change.  To run them you need to ensure that all of the .jar's from the lib folder are specified on the JVM's classpath.  The best way is the make an enviroment variable, say ROBBYSIMLIB, linking to all the the .jar's. Then 

scala -classpath $ROBBYSIMLIB scriptname.scala

will run the script.
