Most of these example scripts are written in Scala. Currently version 2.8 is used, but this might change.  To run them you need to ensure that all of the .jar's from the lib folder are specified on the JVM's classpath.  The best way is the make an enviroment variable, say PUBSIMLIB, linking to all the the .jar's. For example, in unix do

export PUBSIMLIB=$PUBSIMDIR/lib/RobbySim.jar:$PUBSIMDIR/lib/colt.jar:$PUBSIMDIR/lib/flanagan.jar:$PUBSIMDIR/lib/RngPack.jar:$PUBSIMDIR/lib/Jama-1.0.2.jar

where $PUBSIMDIR is the directory pointing to the pubsim files. Then the command

scala -classpath $PUBSIMDIR scriptname.scala

will run the script.
