The run simulations for single frequncy estimation. There are numerous estimators in the library. See Chapter 9 of

R. G. McKilliam. Lattice theory, circular statistics and polynomial phase signals. PhD thesis, University of Queensland, Australia, October 2010.

The file sim.scala acutally runs the simulations. The file clts.scala computes the central limit theorems for this estimator.
