The robbysim library is released under the CRAPL academic license http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/. As such it comes with no guarantees as to it's correctness/intelligibility. 

I tend to use scripts of one form or other to actually run the simulations. In the past I have used both Ruby and Python for this, but these days I use Scala. Some example scripts are contained in the examples folder. I am continually adding to this software so there is no guarantee that the scripts will continue to work forever!
